# The Drinksly

The Drinksly is a React/Node front end application that allows users to search for popular alcoholic drink recipes. 

Prominent Technologies, Techniques and Packages:
 * React Helmet for SEO (node)
 * react-snap for SEO Prerendering (node)
 * react-search-box and react-collapsible (node) to speed development of our search/filter tools.

Our application is also responsive and mobile friendly. This project was built entirely around SEO data on googles most searched alcoholic drink recipes. The drinks we choose to have in our library, the landing pages for filtering drinks down and the keywords used are all carefully crafted. Though the app is relatively simple since it requires no back end, of the three SEO/production websites we built in 2019-2020, this one is showing the most natural search growth. After about 4-5 months since first being published online, we're starting to see 100+ views per month on google searches.
